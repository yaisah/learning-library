# Create and enable a graph user in SQLDeveloper Web

## Introduction
This lab walks you through the steps to get started with SQL Developer Web. You will learn how to create a user in SQL Developer Web and provide that user the access to SQL Developer Web.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

- Learn how to create a database user in SQLDeveloperWeb.

### Prerequisites
* A cloud account
* Autonomous Database instance

## **STEP 1:** Create the Customer_360 user

1. Login as the Admin user in SQLDevWeb of the newly created ADB Free Tier instance.

  Go to your Cloud Console, click **Autonomous Transaction Processing**. Select the ADB instance **ATP Finance Mart** you created in Lab 3.

  In Autonomous Database Details page, click **Service Console**. Make sure your browser allow pop-up windows.

  Choose Development from the list on the left, then click the **SQL Developer Web**.

  Enter `ADMIN` as Username, and the enter the password you set up at Lab 2, Step 2, Section 7.

  Login as the ADMIN user.

2. Now create the `CUSTOMER_360` user. Enter the following commands into the SQL Worksheet and run it while connected as the Admin user.  
    Note: Replace **<specify_a_password>** with a valid password string after copying and pasting the text below but **before executing** it in SQLDeveloperWeb.

    ```
    <copy>
    CREATE USER customer_360 
    IDENTIFIED BY <specify_a_password> 
    DEFAULT TABLESPACE data 
    TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp 
    QUOTA UNLIMITED ON data;  

    GRANT connect, resource TO customer_360;
    </copy>
    ```

  *Note: The `IDENTIFIED BY` clause specifies the password (“<specify_a_password>”)*


## **STEP 2:** Enable SQLDevWeb for Customer_360

  1. Now provide SQLDevWeb access for this user. See the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/sql-developer-web.html#GUID-4B404CE3-C832-4089-B37A-ADE1036C7EEA)
  for details.
    First clear the previous text in the SQL Worksheet. 

    Copy and paste the following text into the SQL Worksheet and run it. 
    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
      ORDS_ADMIN.ENABLE_SCHEMA(
        p_enabled => TRUE,
        p_schema => 'CUSTOMER_360',
        p_url_mapping_type => 'BASE_PATH',
        p_url_mapping_pattern => 'c360',
        p_auto_rest_auth => TRUE
      );
      COMMIT;
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

  ![Enable SQLDevWeb for Customer_360](images/ADB_SDW_EnableLoginFor_C360.png " ")

  The URL for SQLDeveloperWeb for the Customer_360 user will have `c360` in place of `admin` in it.   
  Save the URL for the next step.  

  For details, see the ["Provide SQL Developer Web Access to Database Users"](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/sql-developer-web.html#GUID-4B404CE3-C832-4089-B37A-ADE1036C7EEA) section in the documentation.
